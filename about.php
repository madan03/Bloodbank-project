                    Blood donors should be in good health and not suffer from any serious illness. It is very important to ensure that the act of donating blood does not jeopardize the donor's health in any way. Safe blood is blood that does not contain viruses, bacteria, parasites, drugs or other injurious factors that may harm a blood recipient. Donated blood must also not harm the recipient. It must be safe for transfusion to those who need it. </p>

                        As you know, blood is a life saving medicine, which works wonders in certain medical treatments, and life threatening situations. Our society is threatened by scarcity of blood and the only blood source today is human being. This issue has got further complexes by professional donors, who donate blood for money. These donors have contributed towards rapid spread of killer diseases like AIDS, Hepatitis B & Hepatitis C in the society. Your regular donation will go a long way in salvaging the situation.
